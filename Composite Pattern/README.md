<p><strong><span style="font-size: 26px;">The Composite Design Pattern</span></strong></p>
<p>This is a very simple but powerful design pattern. You don&apos;t have to care about the complexity of the concrete objects, it simply runs them recursively.</p>
<p>I think my UML diagram helps visualize it better.</p>
<p>In this program, we have 3 classes:</p>
<p><strong>Object:&nbsp;</strong>This is an abstract &quot;component&quot; that contains the render method that will be inherited by each child class.</p>
<p><strong>Shape:&nbsp;</strong>This is one of the children of Object. It inherits the render method and the logic is unique to this class.</p>
<p><strong>Group:&nbsp;</strong>This class is designed to hold objects. Which means it can hold itself as well. This contains a list of all the objects it will be composed of.</p>
<p>It will iterate through this list and apply the render() method for each object. What is great about this is the late binding polymorphism. If this object contains groups it will be able to flexibly recursively run the render() methods within those specific groups.</p>
<p>This creates an opportunity for a unique composite structure that is very scalable and flexible.</p>
