<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">The Singleton Pattern</span></strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This is a very simple design pattern. Some consider it to be an &quot;anti&quot; pattern and therefore is becoming less popular.</p>
<p>In this project we only have 1 class the ConfigMangager(singleton).</p>
<p>The purpose of this pattern is to create a class that can only be instantiated once and then is reused.</p>
<p>So the construction of the class is prevented and then instead an internal instantiation of itself is called in the context of when you would normally instantiate the class itself.</p>
