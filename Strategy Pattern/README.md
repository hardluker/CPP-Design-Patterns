<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 26px;">Strategy Design Pattern</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look at the UML document for a layout of the program.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Strategy Design Pattern is yet another implementation of polymorphism and open closed principle. This means an object can take many forms and the classes are open to extension and closed to modification.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In this example, we have an image compressor that uses functions through a polymorphic abstraction of applying filters and compressing images to different formats.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Although this may seem similar to the state pattern, there are some distinct differences here. In the state pattern different behaviors are implemented depending on the state of the object.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In contrast the strategy pattern does not have a single state. Different behaviors are represented using different &quot;strategy&quot; objects.&nbsp;</p>
