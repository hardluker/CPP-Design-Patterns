<p><strong><span style="font-size: 26px;">The Template Method Pattern</span></strong></p>
<p>This Design pattern was quite fun to implement. Essentially you have a base class with an abstract method that will be unique to each child class. However, this method will be protected and inaccessible by the children classes.</p>
<p>Within the base class Task here you have the execute() method that contains the abstracted doExecute() method as well as the necessary audit record() method.</p>
<p>This greatly reduces boilerplate and allows the software to easily add more tasks while being able to set strict requirements that all executions must carry out.</p>
