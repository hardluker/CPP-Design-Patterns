<p><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">The Bridge Pattern</span></strong></p>
<p>This structural pattern is used to have a &quot;bridge&quot; between two separate hierarchies that would otherwised be blended together creating a more complex and difficult-to-manage hierarchy. This implementation has two hierarchies a feature hierarchy and an implementation hierarchy.</p>
<p>It is meant to represent a universal remote setup.</p>
<p>Feature Hierarchy Classes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>RemoteControl:&nbsp;</strong>This is a base class that contains the Device objects and implements them polymorphically through it&apos;s turnOn and turnOff methods.</li>
    <li><strong>AdvancedRemoteControl:&nbsp;</strong>This inherits all the features of the parent class while adding the setChannel method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation Hierarchy Classes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Device:&nbsp;</strong>This is an abstract class that functions as the &quot;bridge&quot; between the hierarchies.</li>
    <li><strong>SonyTV:&nbsp;</strong>This implements the specific logic for a SonyTV interaction from a remote.</li>
    <li><strong>SamsungTV:&nbsp;</strong>This implements the specific logic for a SamsungTV interaction from a remote.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bridge pattern is an excellent way to clean up unnecessarily complex hierarchies and make them expandable and flexible.</p>
